TOP_3_ SOLUTIONS  FOR   SMART FASHION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
	
Fashion Recommendation System (FRS), Algorithmic Models and Filtering Techniques:
FRS can be defined as a means of feature matching between fashion products andusers or consumers under specific matching criteria. Different research addressed apparelattributes such as the formulation of colors, clothing shapes, outfit or styles, patterns orprints and fabric structures or textures. Guan et al. studied these featuresusing image recognition, product attribute extraction and feature encoding. Researchershave also considered user features such as facial features, body shapes, personal choice orpreference, locations and wearing occasions in predicting users’ fashion interests. A well-defined user profile can differentiate a more personalized or customized recommendation system from a conventional system .
 Various research projects onapparel recommendation systems with personalized styling guideline and intelligent recommendation engines have been conducted based on similarity recommendation and expert advisor recommendation systems [10,58,61]. Image processing, image parsing, sensory engineering, computational algorithms, and computer vision techniques have been extensively employed to support these systems.
2.Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a form of artificial neural network architecture thatcontains a series of layers, which are composed of neurons and their connections. The neurons have the ability to calculate the weighted sum of its inputs and apply an activation function to obtain a signal, which is transmitted to the next neuron. The number of  layers can be from 2 to infinity as more and more deep neural networks are introduced depending on the project goal. The batch value and neurons vary but not limited from 8 to 64 and 128 to 512, respectively. Usually, the input and output layers have linear activation function, and the hidden layers commonly have Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax, tanh, etc.
The common optimizers used in MLP are Adam, Adadelta, Adagrad, Adamax, Nadam,SGD, RMSprop, etc.
3.Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are deep-learning-based generative models in which two neural networks (generator and discriminator) compete to become more accurate in their predictions. The goal of the generator is to artificially manufacture (fake) outputs that could easily be mistaken for real data and the discriminator tries to identify which output is not real.
Among the two major components of GAN: the generator network is a simple feedforward neural network (i.e., five layers) and the discriminator network is a classifier,which is slightly different from the generator network. The discriminator network processes the image and gives a probability of a class for that image. Calculation of a GAN’s accuracy is performed using a scoring algorithm such as using pre-trained inception V3n network by comparing extracted features of both the generated and real image.
